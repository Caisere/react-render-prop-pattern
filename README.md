# React Render Prop Pattern

## Understanding the Render Props Pattern in React
The Render Props pattern is a powerful technique in React where a component receives a function as a prop (typically called render) that determines what and how to render content. This function provides the component with the necessary data and behavior it needs to render its output.

### How It Works
- Component Structure: A component accepts a function prop (often named render, but can be any name)

- Control Inversion: The parent component controls the rendering logic

- Data Sharing: The child component passes data to the render function
